# B5203E-TSAF
Time Series Analytics and Forecasting 

# Course objectives

The course objectives are to learn the theory and practice of time series forecasting. At the end of the course you'll be able to answer these questions:

- what can be forecasted and with which accuracy?
- what methods can be used to forecast time series, and which one should I use?
- how can I take optimal decisions based on probabilistic forecasting?

### **Course Meeting Times**

1 session / week, 3 hours / session + 1 async hour, 3.0 ECTS

### Prerequisites

- basic knowledge of python
- basic knowledge of calculus and analysis

### Teaching materials

- Notion slides
- Interactive colab notebooks
- [textbook](https://otexts.com/fpppy/): **Forecasting: Principles and Practice, the Pythonic Way**
- additional reading materials

### Assignments and Evaluation

- group works: evaluated but not part of final mark
- **20%**: mini challenge: forecasting pipeline for a single time series. Groups allowed.
- **60%**: final project: complex forecasting task. Groups allowed (same as mini challenge)
- **20%**: oral exam. During the oral students will present the final challenge group work (each student will present a specific part, but all should be able to answer questions related to any part of the project). You should prepare to answer additional questions on course theory.
